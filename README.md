# Multi-Threading-SpreadSheet
c# application of a spreadsheet (similer to google docs) supporting multi threading users  

I created a spreadsheet application - you can load a document and set changes and save it.

The simulator presents a simulation of several threads using the spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet app is the use of one user in the app .

The pdf document presents the important methods of the spreadsheet.
